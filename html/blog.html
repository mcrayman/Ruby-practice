      <h2>Definition and Purpose of HTML</h2>
      <p>Posted on March 28, 2024 by Matt</p>
      <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup
        language used to create and structure web pages and web applications. At its core,
        HTML allows the embedding of images, text, videos, and other multimedia elements
        into a coherent, navigable webpage. It provides the bones of a website, dictating the
        structure and layout of various elements. HTML is foundational to the web; it
        enables the creation of visually engaging and interactive web pages, serving as the
        backbone for most online content</p>

      <h2>Brief History of HTML</h2>
      <p>Posted on March 29, 2024 by Matt</p>
      <p>HTML was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. Initially, it was designed to
        meet the demand for an internet-based hypertext system to share documents
        among researchers at CERN. Over the years, HTML has evolved through several
        versions, each adding new elements, attributes, and capabilities, reflecting the
        growing needs of the internet community. HTML 4.01, a major version, was
        standardized in 1999 and served as the core markup language for web content until
        the advent of HTML5. Throughout its evolution, HTML has been instrumental in
        shaping the internet, influencing how content is presented and interacted with
        online.</p>

      <h2>HTML vs. HTML5</h2>
      <p>Posted on March 30, 2024 by Matt</p>
      <p>The transition from HTML to HTML5 marked a significant evolution in the web
        development community. While HTML provided the basic structure for web pages,
        HTML5 introduced more integrated and interactive features, eliminating the need
        for external plugins like Flash for multimedia content. HTML5 brought new
        semantic elements (like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;) that describe
        the structure of the webpage more clearly, improving accessibility and search
        engine optimization. Additionally, HTML5 supports multimedia elements (&lt;audio&gt;
        and &lt;video&gt;), graphical content (&lt;canvas&gt;), and advanced features for web
        applications, including offline storage, drag-and-drop, and direct access to the
        device's hardware. This evolution signifies HTML5's role in catering to the dynamic
        and interactive nature of modern web applications.</p>
